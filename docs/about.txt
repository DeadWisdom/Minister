The Minister of Web Services
===================================

Minister is a web-server that matches the needs of modern web development. 
Rarely do we have simple html files sitting in directories any more.  Today,
applications are complex and dynamic yet our servers still adhere to old
expectations and assumptions.

Minister has five primary goals:

* Make application deployment extremely simple.
* Separate applications into distinct environments.
* Monitor, restart, and scale applications automatically.
* Provide a web-resource for the server itself.
* Do all this with competitive speed and security.

To do this, Minister starts up a front-end process, and then creates
sub-processes for every application, which it then proxies requests to. It's a
lot like using nginx in front of multiple web servers, except unlike nginx,
Minister handles all the leg-work. Deploying a complex web application becomes
as simple as making a quick configuration json file and dropping the source
into a directory.
